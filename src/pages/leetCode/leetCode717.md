## Description
两个字符，第一个只能用'0'表示，第二个可以用'10'或者'11'表示。现在给一个String，问是否最后一个字符只能是第一个字符。

Example 1:
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
